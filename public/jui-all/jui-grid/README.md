## Getting Started

#### Loading resources
JUI library only requires the user to load a single package file.
Access to the jui class must then be configured in the markup.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/grid.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/grid-jennifer.min.css" />
<body class="jui">...</body>
```

As the script works only with jQuery 1.8 or higher, it is necessary to load the jQuery library first.
```html
<script src="lib/jquery-1.8.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="lib/core.min.js"></script>
<script src="dist/grid.min.js"></script>
```

#### Installing in command
```
npm install jui-grid
bower install jui-grid
jamjs install jui-grid
```

#### To build the project
Build using a grunt in JUI Library
```
grunt       // Build all processes
grunt js    // Merge and Minifiy JavaScript files
grunt css   // Compile LESS files
grunt test  // Unit Tests
```
After the build output is shown below.
```
dist/grid.js
dist/grid.min.js
dist/grid.css
dist/grid.min.css
dist/grid-jennifer.css
dist/grid-jennifer.min.css
